## Viewing the Slides in a Browser
In a Linux or macOS system, you can build the presentation and start the slideshow be navigating to the `slides` subdirectory and running `npm start`.
This *should* build and serve the slideshow, then open your default browser to the slideshow. If not, the slideshow should be located at http://localhost:3000/
```
$ cd slides
$ npm start
```

## Inspirations, Recommendations, and Other Favorites
### [Book: You Look Like a Thing and I Love You, by Janelle Shane](https://www.amazon.com/You-Look-Like-Thing-Love/dp/0316525243)
This is a great book full of anecdotes about AI side-by-side with the concepts that caused/created the anecdotes.  
A big chunk of the presentation was based on this book, and some examples were just plain stolen.

### Book/Movie: Moneyball
Not directly related to machine learning, but this book and the story behind it is a great example of how there are hidden causes and statistics everywhere if we just look.  
Machine learning models are particularly great at unearthing these hidden gems.
